# Url-Shortener
A Nodejs REST API to shorten a url

Instructions:
To run the tests:

1. Clone the repository,  "git clone https://github.com/ephremt/UrlShortner.git"
2. cd to  UrlShortner
3. run "npm install"
4. run "npm test" to run functional tests.

To run the application locally:

1. cd to UrlShortner
2. run "node server.js"

At this point you can use client tools like post-man (a google chrome extension) to make a POST request to send a long url and get shortened one or do a GET request to get a long version of the shortened url.
